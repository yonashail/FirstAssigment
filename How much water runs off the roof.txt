4. How much water runs off the roof

Algorithm
calculate and find the result of roof dimension in inches by multiplying roof dimension by 12
then calculate runnoff rainfall in cubic inches by multiplying roof dimension in inches by number of inches of rainfall
then finally calculate runoff rainfall in gallons by dividing runoff rainfall in cubic inches by 231.

Pseudocode

DEFINE roofdimension as number
DEFINE numberofinchesofrainfall as number
DEFINE runoffrainfallincubicinches as number
DEFINE runoffrainfallingallons as number
PROMPT user for roofdimension
  INPUT roofdimension
PROMPT user for numberofinchesofrainfall
  INPUT numberofinchesofrainfall
CALCULATE roofdimensionininches =(roofdimension)*12
  DISPLAY "roofdimensionininches"
THEN
CALCULATE runoffrainfallincubicinches= roofdimensionininches*numberofinchesofrainfall
  DISPLAY "runoffrainfallincubicinches"
CALCULATE runoffrainfallingallons = (runoffrainfallincubicinches/231)
  PRINT "runoffrainfallingallons"
